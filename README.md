# User Registration
  The TaskManagement.API provides a user-friendly and secure user registration process, 
  allowing individuals to create accounts and gain access to the powerful features of the application. <br />
  Overview of the registration process: <br />
  
<strong>Step 1: Account Information</strong> <br />
Users start by navigating to the registration page, where they are prompted to provide
essential account information. This includes: <br />
•	<strong>Username:</strong> Users choose a unique username that will identify them within the system. <br />
•	<strong>Email Address:</strong> A valid email address is required for communication and account recovery. <br />
•	<strong>Password:</strong> Users create a strong password to secure their account.

<strong>Step 2: Profile Details</strong> <br />
After providing account information, users are guided to enter their profile details.
This step includes: <br />
•	<strong>First Name and Last Name:</strong> Users enter their full names for personalized identification. <br />
•	<strong>User Role:</strong> Users select their designated role (e.g., Tester, Developer, Team Lead, Product Manager, Designer) from the available options. This role defines their responsibilities and permissions within the application. <br />

<strong>Step 3: Account Creation</strong> <br />
  With the necessary information submitted, users proceed to create their account.
  During this step: <br />
  • User-provided data is validated to ensure accuracy and prevent errors. <br />
  • Passwords are securely hashed to protect user credentials. <br />
  • Account creation prompts users with clear instructions and validation messages. <br />

 # Role-Based Access
  The registration process ensures that each user is assigned a specific role that aligns with their responsibilities. This role         
  determines the tasks and features users can access within the application, creating a tailored experience that enhances collaboration 
  and productivity.
  
# Authentication and Authorization
  The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and supports role-based authorization. 
  Users can log in, receive access and refresh tokens, and use these tokens to access protected endpoints.

# User Roles and Authorization
  The TaskManagement.API utilizes role-based authorization to control access to various parts of the application.
  There are two categories of roles: system roles and basic roles.

 <strong>1. System Roles</strong> <br />
   • Admin Role - Admins can perform administrative tasks, manage users' roles, and have full access to all tasks. <br />
   • SuperAdmin Role - The SuperAdmin role has the highest level of access and control.
     SuperAdmins can manage system-wide settings, configurations, and perform advanced administrative tasks.
     
  <strong>2. Basic Roles</strong> <br />
     • This Include: Tester, Developer, Designer, TeamLead and ProductManager Roles - These roles define the level of access and control users have within the application.
